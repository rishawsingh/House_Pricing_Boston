# House_Pricing_Boston



## OVERVIEW 
In this project we are going to do implementing a scalable model for predicting the house price prediction using some of the regression techniques based of some of features in the dataset which is called Boston House Price Prediction. 

## BUISNESS PROBLEM
The Boston Housing Dataset consists of price of houses in various places in Boston. Alongside with price, the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes that are available.

Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s data-set proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

## About the Dataset
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that is able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.
In this dataset made for predicting the Boston House Price Prediction. Here I just show the all of the feature for each house separately. Such as Number of Rooms, Crime rate of the House’s Area and so on.

1. CRIM per capital crime rate by town
2. ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
9. RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
10.TAX full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 USD
11. PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. Black 1000(Bk — 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT % lower status of the population

## MODELS
The dataset was tested on two Regression models
Linear Regression Model
Random Forest Regression

## PREDICTION AND FINAL SCORE:
Finally we made it!!!
Linear Regression
Model Score: 73.73% Accuracy
Training Accuracy: 77.30% Accuracy
Testing Accuracy: 58.98% Accuracy

Random Forest Regressor
Training Accuracy: 98.36% Accuracy.
Testing Accuracy: 77.378% Accuracy

Output & Conclusion

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we could generate insight from the data. How each of the features relates to the target. Also, it can be seen from the evaluation of the models that Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression.
